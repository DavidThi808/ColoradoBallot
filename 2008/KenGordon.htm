      <h2>From: Ken Gordon </h2>
      <h1>Title: Ballot Measures for Dummies </h1>
      <p>Dear Friends and Neighbors: </p>
      <p>I know you're not actually dummies. That's why I'm sending this to you. This   e-mail contains a brief discussion of the statewide ballot measures. I try to   give enough information so that you can decide how to vote for yourself,   although I will tell you where I stand so you can take my recommendation if   you'd like. My recommendation is at the beginning of each section, right after   the Amendment or Referenda number. Where possible, my recommendation is a link   to a website with more information about each measure. </p>
      <p>Don't skip the ballot measures and just vote for candidates. These ballot   measures affect the schools your children attend, the roads you drive on, the   air you breathe, the water you drink, your civil rights, and the welfare of   Colorado's disabled citizens. When ordinary citizens don't participate, they   create a vacuum that is filled by special interests who try to make a profit at   your expense or advance an ideological interest that does not reflect your   values. </p>
      <p>On the inside cover of your Blue Book, there is a page that you can use to   note your votes. &nbsp;You can take this with you to the polls. I urge all of you to   vote early, or by mail. The ballot is long, and the turnout is expected to be   huge. By voting early, or by mail, you take some of the pressure off of Election   Day, and you may save yourself from having to wait in a long line. </p>
      <p>Initiatives and referenda are two of the tools of direct democracy put into   the Colorado Constitution during the Progressive Era at the turn of the last   century. The people of Colorado felt, with reason, that their legislature at   that time was controlled by the railroads and eastern trusts, and they wanted a   way to create laws on their own. They did not want to have to rely on what they   felt was a corrupt legislature. &nbsp; </p>
      <p>This ballot contains fourteen initiatives, numbered 46 through 59, and four   referenda, L through O. Referenda are referred by the legislature. That is how   you can remember, referenda are referred. Initiatives arrive on the ballot   without any legislative action, by petition. You have seen people collecting   signatures at supermarkets. That is for initiatives. </p>
      <p><strong>Amendment 46: No</strong> This is a proposed Constitutional Amendment which   will prevent Colorado government from using affirmative action programs. Its   intent is to prevent universities or other government programs from considering   race or gender when granting admission, a contract, or other benefit.   Conservatives generally support this amendment, and those on the left side of   the spectrum will generally vote &quot;No.&quot; Since affirmative action programs in   Colorado are narrowly tailored to correct the effects of past discrimination I   will be voting no. </p>
      <p><strong>Amendment 47: No</strong> &nbsp;This is a proposed Constitutional Amendment that   will prevent unions from bargaining for something called a &quot;union shop.&quot; This   proposal is called &quot;Right to Work,&quot; and if it passes, it will make it very   difficult to organize a union because every employee will get the benefit of the   unions' collective barganing whether or not they support the union. There is no   incentive to pay union dues. &quot;Right to Work&quot; has been proposed numerous times in   the legislature and has never passed. Employees tend to earn less money and have   fewer benefits in &quot;Right to Work&quot; states. The unions call it the &quot;Right to Work   for Less.&quot; </p>
      <p>On October 2nd labor and the mainstream business community announced an   agreement that labor would withdraw Amendments 53, 55, 56 and 57, and most of   the business community has agreed to oppose 47, 49 and 54. I feel that labor and   the mainstream business community acted as adults, ending a game of &quot;chicken&quot;   that would have been bad for Colorado, so I am supportive of the agreement. The   Governor and the mainstream business community asked the proponents of 47 to   withdraw it when labor withdrew the amendments that the business community   opposed. They refused. I believe they were excessively ideological and rigid,   not caring sufficiently about the welfare of Colorado. Most of the business   community does not feel that the balance between labor and business in Colorado   is problematic, and they did not feel that 47 was necessary. </p>
      <p><strong>Amendment 48: No</strong> &nbsp;This is the proposed &quot;Personhood&quot; Constitutional   Amendment. It says that as soon as an egg is fertilized by a sperm it becomes a   &quot;Person.&quot; The intent of the proponents is to create a test case in Colorado to   challenge the US Supreme Court case &quot;Roe v. Wade,&quot; which allows a woman to   choose to terminate a pregnancy. The proponents want this to be considered   murder. I think the proponents have gone too far for their own good because   under the provisions of this amendment, there could be no allowance for a   pregnancy caused by rape or incest. Additionally, many kinds of birth control   prevent a fertilized egg from implanting on the uterine wall, so this birth   control would also cause the death of a &quot;person.&quot; What is a woman who has an   ectopic pregnancy supposed to do, and what is the doctor supposed to do with   excess fertilized eggs after an in vitro procedure has been successful? The   Amendment is extreme and will not make for a sympathetic case to take to the   Supreme Court. If you take the position that a woman should never have the right   to terminate her pregnancy, no matter what the reason, you should vote for this. </p>
      <p><strong>Amendment 49: No</strong> &nbsp;This Amendment is part of the package that the   business and labor community agreed to oppose on October 2nd. The Amendment   would prohibit public employee paycheck deductions for any purpose other than   those listed in law. The purpose is to prevent union members from choosing to   have their union dues automatically taken as deductions. This measure has   consistently failed in the legislature. &nbsp; </p>
      <p><strong>Amendment 50: No recommendation</strong> This measure allows gaming communities   to vote to raise their hours, stakes, and to add additional games. Increased tax   revenue will go to community colleges. I'm torn. Community colleges certainly   need the money, but I generally don't like to fund state services through   gambling. I'm leaving you on your own on this one. </p>
      <p><strong>Amendment 51: Yes</strong> &nbsp;Colorado does a very poor job of funding services   for people with disabilities (46th among the states). This statutory amendment   raises state sales tax from 2.9% to 3.1% in order to provide these services.   That is two cents on a ten dollar purchase. In terms of reducing human   suffering, this is the best value you can get for your money, and it makes sense   as an investment as well. Additional services provided at an early age to people   with conditions like cerebral palsy, autism and Down's syndrome will   significantly reduce the number of tax dollars that will be needed for long term   care. These services can vastly improve the lives of our disabled population.   Anyone with a heart should vote &quot;yes&quot; on this measure. The Rocky Mountain News   editorialized in favor of this measure. </p>
      <p><strong>Amendment 52: No</strong> &nbsp;This amendment will take some of the current stream   of severance taxes (taxes paid for the privilege of severing-or   extracting-minerals, oil, and gas from the earth and selling them for private   gain) and divert them to highway construction. Some of the losers, if this   passes, are water projects, wildlife conservation, and low income energy   assistance. &nbsp;We do need more money for highway construction, but this does not   provide enough and takes away from other worthwhile projects. &nbsp; </p>
      <p><strong>Amendment 53: This measure has been withdrawn.</strong> &nbsp;It will appear on your   ballot, but the votes will not be counted. </p>
      <p><strong>Amendment 54: No</strong> &nbsp;This measure will prevent labor unions and other   contractors from making campaign contributions to political candidates under   certain circumstances. I actually feel that money in politics does have a   distorting effect and is one of the reasons that our governmental institutions   tend to arrive at results that too often favor wealthy special interests. This   Amendment, though, seems to take a disproportionate shot at labor unions and has   very little effect on businesses. If we are going to try to reduce the influence   of money, it should be done across the board and not be an attempt by one group   to reduce the contributions of another while maintaining their own. </p>
      <p><strong>Amendment 55, 56 and 57: These measures have been withdrawn.</strong> &nbsp;They   will appear on your ballot, but the votes will not be counted. </p>
      <p><strong>Amendment 58: Yes</strong> &nbsp;Currently Colorado has one of the lowest tax rates   on the production of minerals and oil and gas of any of the eight large   producing western states. Wyoming, for instance, has a tax rate twice that of   Colorado and uses the money from this tax to send all of its graduating high   school seniors with good grades to college. If Amendment 58 passes, it will   raise about $300,000,000 for need-based college scholarships, development of   renewable energy resources, wildlife habitat, transportation, and clean water   projects. You need to know that the oil industry is spending millions of dollars   on misleading advertising opposing this measure. The Amendment does not raise   any tax that any ordinary Colorado citizen has to pay. The only contributors to   the &quot;No&quot; campaign are oil and gas companies, and they are writing million-dollar   checks. It is only fair that Colorado's citizens receive some of the benefit of   this natural resource. Before too long it will be gone. It is appropriate for us   to put some of the current proceeds into human capital by educating our young   people, and to also support the next generation of energy. Governor Ritter is   one of the proponents of this measure, and he has been taking quite a few shots   for his position. We should support him and this measure because it is in all of   our interests... unless you own a big oil and gas company (the small ones are   exempted.). </p>
      <p><strong>Amendment 59: Yes</strong> &nbsp;This ballot measure is referred to as SAFE (Savings   Account for Education). &nbsp;If SAFE passes it will put the money from future TABOR   rebates into the State Education Fund. Colorado does a poor job funding   education, and SAFE will help with this funding in future years. &nbsp;TABOR rebates   only occur when the economy is in boom times, and the state collects more taxes   than it spends, so there are no rebates expected in the next few years. However,   in my view, the passage of SAFE is very important to Colorado's future. TABOR   preserves the right of voters to vote on tax increases. If you believe that   skimping on education is not a good strategy as we try to compete in a global   market, then you will vote &quot;Yes&quot; on Amendment 59, SAFE. </p>
      <p><strong>Referendum L: Yes</strong> &nbsp;This measure reduces the age requirement for   serving in the state legislature from 25 to 21. Many states do this, and the   only people of this age who will end up serving are people who can convince a   majority, first of their party that they deserve the nomination, and then of the   general electorate that they are the best candidate. It might inspire young   people to pay more attention to politics. &nbsp; </p>
      <p><strong>Referenda M and N: Yes</strong> &nbsp;These measures remove obsolete portions of the   State Constitution. They are not controversial. </p>
      <p><strong>Referendum O: Yes</strong> &nbsp;This measure will decrease the number of signatures   needed to put a statutory initiative on the ballot and increase the number of   signatures needed to put a Constitutional Amendment on the ballot. It also   increases the number of votes necessary to change a statutory initiative by   subsequent legislative action. The idea is to channel more of the initiatives   into statutes rather than the Constitution. Since a Constitution is supposed to   be a document that expresses big, general principles rather than detail, I think   this is a step in the right direction. </p>
