      <h2><s>57: Companies Liable for any Injury </s></h2>
      <h1>This initiative has been withdrawn</h1>
      <p class="textMain">The unions have withdrawn initiatives 53, 55, 56, &amp; 57. They will still appear on the ballot but will not be counted. The anti-union initiatives 47, 49, &amp; 54 remain on the ballot - please vote no on them. </p>
      <h1>Summary</h1>
      <p class="textMain">The measure would require every employer in Colorado to provide their employees   with a &quot;safe and healthy work environment.&quot; Failure to comply with obligations   of the measure, if passed, would open employers to damage lawsuits that could be   filed by injured employees, in addition to any claims through the workers   compensation system. <strong>No definition of &quot;safe and healthy&quot; is included in the   proposal. </strong></p>
      <p class="textMain">This initiative is part of the union's response that will <a href="APoxOnBothYourHouses.htm">destroy the Labor Peace Act of 1943.</a></p>
      <h1><img src="../images/error.png" alt="Vote NO!" width="24" height="24" /> <img src="../images/bomb.png" alt="Devastating Impact" width="24" height="24" /> Vote No</h1>
      <p class="textMain">Ok, so what exactly is a &quot;safe &amp; healthy&quot; workplace? If a company brings in donuts for all employees, well donuts are bad for you and that is not healthy. Could an employee with cholesterol issues then sue? No one knows. The courts will decide over time.</p>
      <p class="textMain">Also, just how big a problem is this? No workplace is 100% safe, just as no home is. But there have not been any stories, not any, about unsafe working conditions in Colorado recently. This is a solution looking for a problem. (And attorneys will invent the problem to then win awards in court.) </p>
      <p class="textMain">In addition, to continue with the incredibly successful Colorado Labor Peace Act of 1943,<a href="APoxOnBothYourHouses.htm"> this (and the other 6 peace act violators) must be defeated. </a> </p>
      <h1>Arguments Against</h1>
            <p class="textMain">The amendment allows an injured employee -   currently entitled to damages and the full protection of the law - to double-dip   and collect all of the benefits from the Workers Compensation Act no-fault   system of liability, and to sue the company through District Court. This new   dual system will dramatically raise insurance costs and other costs of doing   business in Colorado, which will result in lower wages, lost benefits and   lawsuit abuse.</p>
            <p class="textMain">This system will cost   business and in response those businesses will need to reduce salaries and cut   benefits. Companies that don&rsquo;t leave the state may choose to reduce their labor   force to fewer than 10 employees, transition employees to seasonal, part-time   and independent contractor status, to avoid the impact of this costly measure. </p>
            <p class="textMain">The Amendment will create legal paralysis.   The measure is a trial lawyers dream and a small employer&rsquo;s nightmare. Despite   the fact the amendment allows an injured employee to sue in District Court for   compensatory and punitive damages, if the employer fails to provide a safe and   healthy workplace, the term &ldquo;Safe and healthy workplace&rdquo; is not defined by the   initiative. The language is confusing, misleading and likely to trigger damaging   unintended consequences. </p>
      <h1>Arguments For</h1>
      <p class="textMain">The workers' compensation system does not always meet the needs of injured employees. While an injured employee already receives medical care at no cost, the choice of doctor and treatment options are limited. Further, an injured employee who is unable to work may receive wage payments that are far below the employee's previous take-home earnings. By allowing the courts to review individual cases, Amendment 57 establishes another avenue for employees to seek compensation for injuries, such as pain and suffering, beyond the benefits provided by workers' compensation.</p>
