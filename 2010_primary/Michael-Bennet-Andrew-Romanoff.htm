      <h1>Andrew   Romanoff, Michael Bennet, and the future of our country </h1>
      <p class="textMain">I think <strong>the Senate is key to the future direction of our   country</strong>. In the present political environment it is the key body for   legislation. Therefore who we have in the Senate determines if the country will   improve, hold steady, or worsen. And what each Senator works on, what truly   matters to each, how they vote - has tremendous impact. Because the difference   between a yes and no vote in many cases is a handful of Senators.</p>
      <p class="textMain">As many of you know I <a href="http://www.davidthielen.info/politics/2010/05/why-i-will-not-be-voting-for-senator-bennet-on-saturday.html">dropped   my support of Senator Bennet recently</a> because his votes in the Senate pretty   much <a href="http://www.davidthielen.info/politics/2010/05/why-the-bank-regulations-matter.html">guarantee   that we will have another severe recession due to the banks</a>. That however   did not cause me to jump to support Andrew Romanoff - it put me squarely in the   undecided column. Senator Bennet being bad for our long-term future does not   mean Andrew Romanoff would be better. </p>
      <p class="textMain">One key issue to push aside - the argument by many is that Senator Bennet was   imposed on us by Obama and Ritter and the people of Colorado deserve to select   their own Senator. I'm sorry but while this might be an argument to consider   Romanoff (and I don't think it's much of one), it is in no way an argument to   vote for or against either candidate. This issue is not relevant to deciding who   to vote for. In addition, what someone did for us yesterday is not relevant,   except where it is an indicator of what they will do tomorrow (i.e., the Senate   is not a thank you for a great job as Speaker). </p>
      <p class="textMain">So let's look at the key issues, in order of priority. </p>
      <h3>Financial Reform </h3>
      <p class="textMain">For most of the history of the U.S. we had   numerous wild swings in the business cycle and it wreaked havoc on people's   lives. During the new deal FDR's administration enacted several laws that   smoothed this out - making the booms much longer, the recessions shorter, and   more importantly, the recessions shallower. </p>
      <p class="textMain">This system worked great for 65 years, until we loosened up the regulations,   starting with the Savings &amp; Loan mess and cumulating with the revocation of   Glass-Steagall (signed by President Clinton - fucking the country at the   banker's request is definitely a bi-partisan effort.) If we don't reinstitute   effective reform, then we will continue to be battered by these long deep   recessions every 7 - 15 years. This will be devastating to the world. Yet so far   the Senate has not even been able to reinstitute the FDR laws, much less add   anything new. </p>
      <table border="1" cellpadding="3" width="100%">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td width="50%"><strong>Senator Bennet</strong></td>
            <td width="50%"><strong>Andrew Romanoff</strong></td>
          </tr>
          <tr valign="top">
            <td width="50%" class="textMain">On this issue Senator Bennet has been a consistent vote for the   banks and against the interests of the American people. This includes:
              <ul>
                <li>Voting against reviving Glass-Steagall.
                </li>
                <li>Voting against limiting the size of banks so a single bank cannot destroy   the economy.
                </li>
                <li>Voting against Merkley-Levin (Volker rule).
                </li>
                <li>Voting against cram-down.
                </li>
              </ul>
              In Senator Bennet's favor he did:
              <ul>
                <li>Vote for the Dorgan amendment.
                </li>
                <li>Voted for the final bill.
                </li>
              </ul>
              I don't think Senator Bennet voted   as he did because he is in the back pocket of the banks. But I do think his   years of work in the financial arena means he sees the world through the eyes of   the bankers. Bennet is an example of <a href="http://baselinescenario.com/2010/05/30/the-consensus-on-big-banks-shifts-but-not-at-treasury/">culture   capture</a>.
              <p class="textMain">But the end result is that Senator Bennet will not vote against the   fundamental self-interest of the banks, because he believes what is good for the   banks is good for America. </p></td>
            <td width="50%" class="textMain">It could be as simple as having not worked closely with the   titans of finance, Andrew Romanoff can clearly see what is best for America:
              <ul>
                <li><a href="http://www.andrewromanoff.com/issues/entry/financial-reform/">Favors   reinstituting Glass-Steagall.</a>
                </li>
                <li><a href="http://www.andrewromanoff.com/news/entry/sen.-bennet-votes-to-keep-banks-too-big-to-fail/">Favors   limiting bank size so a single bank cannot destroy the economy.</a>
                </li>
                <li><a href="http://www.andrewromanoff.com/news/entry/romanoff-renews-call-for-audit-of-the-federal-reserve/">Favors   ongoing complete audits of the Fed.</a>
                </li>
                <li><a href="http://www.andrewromanoff.com/news/entry/wall-street-main-street-dividing-line-deepens/">Favors   regulation and transparency of derivatives.</a>
                </li>
                <li><a href="http://www.andrewromanoff.com/issues/entry/financial-reform/">Favors the   creation of a Consumer Financial Protection Agency.</a>
                </li>
              </ul>
              Andrew   Romanoff has come out clearly and specifically in favor of the changes needed to   bring about the changes we need to insure we do not have a repeat of our current   recession.
              <p class="textMain">What's really sad is Andrew's proposals are good not only for the country and   non-bankers, but they are best for the banks too, in the long term. But the   people running the banks, and their fellow travelers, are so short-sighted they   don't see the benefit they gain from a stable system. </p></td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p class="textMain">One very interesting measure of Senator   Bennet's future intentions on this subject is his own website. In his section on <a href="http://bennetforcolorado.com/issues/details/2009-07-economic-recovery">Economic   Recovery</a> he discusses what he has accomplished so far - the credit card   holders bill of rights. That's all. And his listing of what he is working on is   four vague generalities. If even on a campaign website he can't point to much,   it is pretty much an admission by the Bennet campaign that Senator Bennet is not   in favor of the legislation we need to avoid a repeat of the great recession.
 </p>
<p class="textMain"><strong>Senator Bennet is a consistent vote to suffer a long deep financial recession   every decade or so.</strong> Andrew Romanoff would be a consistent vote to restrain the   banks so they cannot trash the economy. On this issue there is a stark   difference between the candidates. (Hint: Unless you're pulling in million   dollar bonuses at a financial institution, you want Romanoff on this issue.) </p>
      <h3>Jobs
      </h3>
      <p class="textMain">We are at an effective unemployment/underemployment rate of   18%. And the unemployment rate is stuck there - Washington is celebrating the   fact that it's stabilized (which granted is a good place to start). But   continuing with 1/5 of our citizens not working is a deadly cancer that eats   away at our society and our country. This is by far the biggest short-term   problem our country faces, and only the federal government can get it unstuck.      </p>

            <td width="50%"><strong>Andrew Romanoff</strong></td>
          </tr>
          <tr valign="top">
            <td width="50%" class="textMain">On Michael Bennet's <a href="http://bennetforcolorado.com/issues/">list of issues</a> on his website,   this comes tenth - as part of the page titled <a href="http://bennetforcolorado.com/issues/details/2009-07-economic-recovery">Economic   Recovery</a>. Clearly not a high priority, which has also been clear from his   efforts in the Senate where he has been mostly silent on this issue. His efforts   to date have been: 
              <ul>
                <li>Voting in favor of ARRA which provided desperately needed short-term relief   and provides jobs.
                </li>
                <li>Several laws to help people hang on to their homes (these have been mostly   ineffective but I don't think that is the fault of the Senate).
                </li>
                <li>Free up credit for small businesses and farms so they stay in business (and   keep people employed).
                </li>
              </ul>
              Senator Bennet also discusses two key   points for improving our economy: 
              <ul>
                <li>Transforming our educational system to meet the needs of today. This is   absolutely the most critical part of a long term answer.
                </li>
                <li>American industries that have fallen behind must learn to be innovative and   create products that are in demand (I'd call this transforming GM to Apple).   Again, a key part of the long term solution (although Senator Bennet did   pressure the Obama administration to fund the Orion project - so apparently this   rule does not hold for federal money going to Colorado jobs).
                </li>
              </ul>
              What   is really interesting here is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Blaze">the dog that didn't bark</a>.   Senator Bennet in his efforts in the Senate, in his speeches, in his website,   with the exception of his ARRA vote - does not speak to the issue of how we   reduce unemployment today (and tomorrow).
              <p class="textMain">Senator Bennet does have a strong grasp of what we need to do medium term to   have a strong growing productive economy. But I don't think he will be involved   in how we address the short term problem of high unemployment. </p>
              <p class="textMain">On the flip side, Senators cannot be experts on everything. And Senator   Bennet's vote on ARRA shows that he will support jobs legislation.
              </p></td>
            <td width="50%" class="textMain">On Andrew Romanoff's <a href="http://www.andrewromanoff.com/pages/issues">list of issues</a> on his   website, this comes first. And in Andrew's case with the focused title of <a href="http://www.andrewromanoff.com/issues/entry/putting-america-back-to-work/">Putting   America Back to Work</a>. Andrew has a strong legislative effort on this from   his time in the house: 
              <ul>
                <li>He was one of the leaders on referendum C that delivered a substantial   increase in jobs. And did so through investments in Colorado that will pay off   for years (in some cases decades).
                </li>
                <li>Along with Ref C there was a massive bond proposal that also would have been   a big win for both the economy and long term investment.
                </li>
              </ul>
              Andrew   also lists a number of specific actions he would take as a Senator to reduce   unemployment. The biggies are: 
              <ul>
                <li>Increasing access for job training and vocational rehabilitation. This is   key for people in industries where the jobs will never come back. It also   reduces unemployment by pulling those people temporarily out of the job market.
                </li>
                <li>Repair and rebuild our infrastructure. This should be a no-brainer (but   apparently is not for many - especially Republicans) as it provides jobs, pays   back the cost many times over, is desperately needed, and is cheap right now   because of the economy.
                </li>
                <li>Get the banks to start lending to small businesses again. The present lack   of credit is holding back business expansion - which holds back new jobs.
                </li>
              </ul>
              Andrew Romanoff has the standard list of progressive answers to   the job crisis. The good news is he clearly sees this as the biggest short-term   problem this country faces. And he wants to address it, and do so without   unending debt. As a Senator I think he will focus on this.</td>

      <p class="textMain">Part of what we presently face is 80% of the   workforce can produce what 100% wants. I call this the Craigslist issue where 27   employees at Craigslist have replaced the 100,000+ who worked for newspapers   selling and producing classified ads. Assuming China no longer wishes to fund   our over-consumption by purchasing our second mortgages, how do we address this   conundrum? I'm not sure how we do so, but I'd sure like to see our candidates   speaking to this problem.      </p>
      <p class="textMain">What is absolutely clear is that we are not going to get this 18% unemployed   unstuck without major focused directed effective effort by the federal   government. FDR's New Deal was looking to take decades to bring us back to full   employment when WWII occurred - and so the recovery was &quot;only&quot; 1 decade.   Duplicating the New Deal (and we're not even doing that yet) means a very long   road to recovery. </p>
      <p class="textMain">On Michael Bennet vs Andrew Romanoff - I think with Michael you will get   someone more focused on what we need to fix medium term while Andrew will be   more focused on reducing unemployment tomorrow. But both will clearly vote for   legislation to address this issue. And both short and medium term are critically   important. (Or to put it another way, if you're unemployed Andrew is your guy   while if you're worried the company you work for may go the way of Chrysler,   Michael's your guy.) </p>
      <p class="textMain"><strong>My $0.02:</strong> I think what would go a long way to pulling us out   of this is to send 5% of the workforce to college on a system like the G.I.   Bill. That would drop the unemployment rate by 1/3 (including additional people   the colleges would have to hire to teach all the new students). It would also   increase the number of workers trained for the jobs of today and tomorrow -   which we desperately need. Like the G.I. Bill, it would be implemented to reduce   unemployment, but would deliver an ROI many times over from the increased   education of our workforce. </p>
      <h3>Education
      </h3>
      <p class="textMain">This is our future. We must fix out K-12 system and rein   in the cost of Higher-Ed.      </p>
      <table border="1" cellpadding="3" width="100%">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td width="50%"><strong>Senator Bennet</strong></td>
            <td width="50%"><strong>Andrew Romanoff</strong></td>
          </tr>
          <tr valign="top">
            <td width="50%" class="textMain"><strong>On education Senator Bennet rocks!</strong> Bennet has a   great record here from when he was Superintendent of the Denver Public Schools,   bringing in a lot of needed improvements over great opposition. He clearly has   great passion on this subject and is willing to do things that are unpopular but   necessary.
              <p class="textMain">Senator Bennet can't point to any great legislation on this issue because the   Senate hasn't done much on education. This does not reflect on Senator Bennet,   it's due mostly to Race to the Top being the main effort at present and that's   done. </p>
              <p class="textMain">It's interesting that on his website he does not call out education   specifically but instead is listed as a key part of most of the issues he lists.   I think this speaks well of Senator Bennet's understanding that education is key   to our future throughout our system. </p>
              <p class="textMain">When Senator Bennet speaks he almost always dives in to education, and does   so in depth. This clearly is an area where he has a lot of passion and puts in a   lot of effort. </p>
              <p class="textMain">Critically important, Senator Bennet has shown he's willing to take on the   entrenched interests in the educational system. Not rolling over for the   teachers unions is very difficult politically for a Democrat, but also   absolutely necessary to fix our schools.
              </p></td>
            <td width="50%" class="textMain">Andrew Romanoff also has a great record on schools. In the   legislature he led the efforts on numerous educational bills. (I'm not listing   the specific bills here because I would probably miss half of what he did.)
              <p class="textMain">He also led the efforts for A59 which would have undone some of the damage   due to TABOR and provided additional funding to our K-12 system. It was a well   designed and strongly supported amendment - on the ballot in a year virtually   everything got a no. </p>
              <p class="textMain"><a href="http://www.andrewromanoff.com/issues/entry/building-a-world-class-school-system/">Andrew's   proposals on education</a> are all good. And he does have the word   accountability in there - but once and in a very general usage. Fixing our K-12   system requires a radical change of the basic system. And doing that is very   upsetting to the people who do well under the current system. </p>
              <p class="textMain">Fixing this will require doing so over the strong opposition of many invested   in the present system. I haven't seen anything in Andrew's efforts to date that   says he's willing to take that on. On the flip side, I haven't seen anything   that says he would not do it either. So they jury's out on this issue. 
              </p></td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p class="textMain">I hate to see the difference here reduce to   one issue. But that is the giant difference between Bennet &amp; Romanoff. Both   are very strong supporters of education. Both have worked in the educational   system. Both understand that this issue alone determines where our country is   100 years from now. Both are great on this issue.
 </p>
<p class="textMain">But we have a giant roadblock to improving our K-12 schools, and that is the   people invested in the present system. This is not just teachers, it is   administrators, parents, consultants, vendors, educational schools, the list   goes on and on. But the teachers unions with their insistence on ironclad job   security is one of the major barriers. And you are not going to convince most   teachers that giving up ironclad job security is a good thing (how can you - it   is a good thing for them). So it has to be done over their strong opposition. </p>
      <p class="textMain">Senator Bennet has shown that he is willing to push on over the opposition of   the teachers unions. Andrew Romanoff has not. And this is the significant   different between the two on education. So on the issue of K-12 Senator Bennet   is better (unless you're a teacher - then Andrew is better). </p>
      <h3>Healthcare 
      </h3>
      <p class="textMain">I think Senator Bennet was great on this issue. He   pushed hard to get HCR through and never asked for a quid-pro-quo for his vote.   He was a loud voice for single payer and Medicare buy-in. He also put a lot of   effort into cost containment which is the unaddressed half of our healthcare   crisis. That is not addressed yet but Bennet tried and that is all we can ask.      </p>
      <p class="textMain">At the same time, Andrew Romanoff is saying much the same thing as Senator   Bennet. I'm not bothering to put up a table comparing them on this issue because   they are essentially identical. (Yes Andrew has claimed he would have done   better if he was Senator for the last year - I put that down to standard   politicking.) </p>
      <p class="textMain">But the big question for both is reigning in costs. The ongoing costs   increases for healthcare are no longer sustainable. How are you going to address   this? Because until you do, we have growing deficits and an inability to fund   other efforts. And the end result is a wildly inflated currency and a severe   depression. (Which would be very bad.) </p>
      <h3>Who to Vote For?
      </h3>
      <p class="textMain">Ok, so come August we can't put the two of them in   a blender and compose the perfect candidate. So who to vote for?      </p>
      <p class="textMain">First, yes there are a number of other issues from energy, the environment   (BP managed to fuck up both), two wars, immigration, and a dysfunctional   political system. And you probably have 3 or 4 other items that are important to   you. But I don't see any of them as having as much impact as the issues I   listed. </p>
      <p class="textMain">On financial reform and short term resolution of the unemployment rate it's   clearly Andrew Romanoff. On medium term changes in the economy and transforming   K-12 schools it's clearly Michael Bennet. Which leaves me undecided (and August   is rapidly approaching - help!).</p>
