      <h2>My Breakfast with Michael</h2>
      <h1>April 2009</h1>
      <p class="textMain">I had the opportunity this morning to talk to Senator Michael Bennet. Michael   describes himself as someone who has been lucky in the opportunities that life   has provided him. I'd phrase it that Michael has worked hard to insure that many   opportunities have come his way and then worked hard to make use of them. As   Nolan Bushnell said <em>&quot;Everyone who's ever taken a shower has an idea. It's   the person who gets out of the shower, dries off and does something about it who   makes a difference.&quot;</em></p>
      <p class="textMain">One item of personal (to me) interest, Michael is the proud father of 3   daughters. As a fellow father of 3 daughters, we traded a couple of stories of   being the one male in the household. He clearly loves his family. </p>
      <p class="textMain">Ok, on to the interview. Michael is running for election in '10. This is his   first time on the ballot and so he has to close the sale with all of Colorado.   Time is short and there's a lot of campaigning to do. So Michael dove right in   to discussing&hellip; how the Denver Public Schools are doing, and what needs to be   addressed in our public school system. Some of it was on changes that had been   wrought in DPS and their effect, and much was on things that remain to be done. </p>
      <p class="textMain">I think he happily could have spent the entire hour discussing public   education, and we did spend over 10 minutes on it. Michael clearly enjoys   talking about how to determine the root cause of the problems we face, and how   to fix them. And gravitates to that, as opposed to selling himself for the next   election. </p>
      <p class="textMain">Add to this Michael's work history, where he has moved to significantly   different job after significantly different job (albeit with a consistent theme   of organizations that are in a world of hurt) and it draws a picture of an   individual who is driven to solve complex systemic problems. (Which begs the   question, I wonder if he would have been interested in the Senate if the country   was running fine.) </p>
      <p class="textMain">So then we launched in to what is he doing for the next 2 years. I postulated   that getting elected is a significant part of his time and he agreed. And with   that he has his covering the state mapped out with what has been hit, what is   coming, when each part was hit, etc. He is very focused and serious on winning   in '10. </p>
      <p class="textMain">But he launched in to discussing the financial mess. He had an interesting   twist on the problem, that having this occur at the end of a deeply unpopular   president's term significantly exacerbated the problem. And that it hit hard   before we knew who the new president would be. And yes, the response from the   Bush administration was pretty minimal and disjointed. </p>
      <p class="textMain">He then talked at length on the work he is putting in with Senator Warner and   others under the direction of Senator Dodd to come up with the needed   regulations to insure this does not happen again. He dove in first to the asleep   at the wheel regulators we had. And the fact that not only was there minimal to   no regulation, but the banks were being encouraged to leverage themselves even   more to 20:1 or even 30:1. Clearly he saw this as insane. </p>
      <p class="textMain">At the same time he talked about the need for the regulation to work well.   That it cannot be too light, but neither can it be a heavy hand that restricts   the ability of the market to provide the best product and for the companies to   operate efficiently. This is a very difficult issue and it will take time to   know if any solution works well, but he does see the trade-offs here. </p>
      <p class="textMain">From this he talked about how the economic mess impacts people. And he talked   about dreams deferred by people who are graduating from High School or College   and will be in a different job, or no job, as opposed to the career they hoped   to get started on. He talked about retired people who have seen their savings   cut in half and are wondering what they are going to do. He sees this as   individual pain that is impacting person after person. </p>
      <p class="textMain">This was surprising that someone who has worked the numbers in most of his   jobs did not talk about unemployment levels, credit tightening, etc &ndash; he talked   about what the impact is on individuals. Michael Bennet is focused on turning   life around for people. And this means that if we get the financial markets   working well again he won't say problem solved, he'll be asking if things are   better for people. He wants to fix the real problem. </p>
      <p class="textMain">He next talked about healthcare. His major discussion was once again   systemic, the fact that we have hit a rare point where everyone, individuals,   businesses, government &ndash; everyone &ndash; sees the need to fix what is a broken   system. And he followed that up with it is absolutely incumbent upon the elected   leaders in Washington to step up to that challenge and solve the problem. </p>
      <p class="textMain">He also talked about how the present system is not sustainable. That the   yearly double digit growth in medical costs flat out cannot continue. This   growth will break the federal budget via Medicare &amp; Medicaid. And that   companies cannot continue to poor more and more money into health insurance   (damn straight!). </p>
      <p class="textMain">And to address this Michael then discussed the advantage of Obama starting   out high-level laying out the major criteria that any solution needs to meet and   getting agreement there before diving into the how. As he said, the beauty of   this as opposed to the approach of starting off with a detailed solution is you   get buy in across the board on coming up with a solution before you hit the   details where you are going to get arguments. </p>
      <p class="textMain">I don't think he has a specific solution in mind. Nor do I think Michael will   be one of the main drivers as to what the details will be. But he clearly is   applying time and attention to getting up to speed on the alternatives and will   probably be a voice at the table as they work out the specifics of the solution.   In other words, it does have his attention, but it does not have a boatload of   his time. </p>
      <p class="textMain">And that's it for policy and legislative activity. I wish there was time for   more as he is a thoughtful and intelligent guy. But our political system is what   it is. And for someone just appointed to the seat, who is a relative unknown to   the voters, and his first election is in 20 months &ndash; this ain't bad. Not if we   want him in office 2 years from now. </p>
      <p class="textMain">Michael talked a lot about meeting the voters. He clearly likes doing this,   he was excited about the meetings with voters he has scheduled today. (Note, I   will be at a Democratic Women of Boulder County meet &amp; greet he is doing   this evening so I will get to see him in action.) He talked a lot about the   variety of questions and concerns he gets at these events. I think he uses these   not just as a way to introduce himself to people, but also to learn about what   the voters are thinking about. </p>
      <p class="textMain">He then touched on the conservadem issue. He made a couple of very good   points. First that he does not take the approach of to the winner goes the   spoils and the Dems now should just ram through what they want. He sees the   election of Obama as not just a repudiation of the Bush policies, but also a   repudiation of the Bush scorched earth tactics. </p>
      <p class="textMain">Keep in mind that Michael is not proposing we must get Republican buy-off on   each issue. His point is that we should try. We should talk and try to bring the   Republicans on board. And he never once said the word cloture, he is talking   about improving the political culture and reaching out to try and bring about   that improvement. </p>
      <p class="textMain">He also was quite indignant about the group that meets being called   conservative. He sees it as a group with a multitude of political views that is   focused on trying to bring about a needed reduction of all out political warfare   and instead have disagreement without it leading to strident posturing. And he   proudly called himself progressive. (Ever notice how no one is liberal anymore &ndash;   we're now all progressive.) He finds a good measure in that in the more   conservative counties he's viewed as a bit more liberal than they would like. </p>
      <p class="textMain">I want to add my personal opinion here. I think it is critical that we get   this country back to the mode where the Democrats &amp; Republicans are working   together for the good of our country. Yes there will be disagreement, and yes   the majority party will prevail most of the time, but it remains a joint effort.   If we don't do this, we run the risk of becoming two closed camps where we   divide the country in half &ndash; and that would be horrible. In addition, the   Republicans do have a lot of good ideas and we need to make use of those ideas,   and the critical review by the Republican members. Ok, rant over. </p>
      <p class="textMain">At the end I asked Michael if he walks into his office next Monday and Reid,   McConnell, Pelosi, &amp; Obama are in his office and tell him that he can hand   them a bill and they will pass it immediately, what would it be. And his answer   was he would like it to be healthcare but he would need more time to craft that   bill. So it would be legislation to make alternative certification for teachers   a reality. </p>
      <p class="textMain">This illustrates a major component of Michael Bennet. Many politicians would   say healthcare. But to him the criteria is a bill that can be presented quickly   and healthcare cannot be crafted that quickly. In other words, instead of a good   political answer, he took the restrictions of that case to heart and thought   through what could be done that quickly. This is someone who focuses on   accomplishment rather than a good sound bite. </p>
      <p class="textMain">Second, he did think for about a minute to come up with the alternative   certification idea. So when he had to drop back to an instinctive from the gut   proposal, he went to education. And he came up with something that is eminently   doable and would provide a lot of bang for the buck. All in all a damn good   answer. And I think a clear indication that once he has more time, education   will be something he puts a lot of effort in to. </p>
      <p class="textMain">I think Michael Bennet has the potential to do great things in the Senate.   Thoughtful, a boatload of varied experience, and someone who looks at things   from a systemic point of view. Add in strong empathy for what people are going   through and a joy in meeting voters. All in all, very very impressive. Plus he's   incredibly personable.</p>
      <p class="textMain">I saw Michael again in the evening - <a href="http://www.davidthielen.info/politics/2009/04/my-dinner-with-michael.html">My   Dinner with Michael.</a>      </p>
