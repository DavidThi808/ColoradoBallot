      <h2>Michael Bennet Primary Interview</h2>
      <h1>December 2009</h1>
      <p class="textMain">The Senate moves with all due deliberation. The federal government changes   direction slowly. Sometimes this is good, sometimes it is bad, oftentimes it is   frustrating. But our government was designed to change slowly and in this the   founding fathers were very effective. </p>
      <p class="textMain">Michael Bennet is a Senator. And the thing that most struck me in this   interview is that he talks about what can be done, and how items need to be   accomplished. Not a word railing against the constraints of the system but   instead straightforward discussion of getting the job done. Senator Bennet's   approach will tend to be less satisfying to those that want major changes, and   want them now. But his approach will also make him a much more effective   Senator. I prefer effective. </p>
      <p class="textMain">On to the interview. This was over the phone as the Senate is in session this   weekend and so Michael is stuck in D.C. And it was just &frac12; hour long (actually 35   minutes). I haven't interviewed over the phone before and it does reduce the   level of communication. It is a much more cut &amp; dried conversation. </p>
      <p class="textMain">We started on Afghanistan. This was a long discussion which pretty much   mirrored President Obama's speech at West Point. Michael does acknowledge that   the real fight is occurring in Pakistan and that is being conducted by the   Pakistani Army. That the job in Afghanistan is to not let the terrorists retreat   from Pakistan to Afghanistan which would then eliminate the effectiveness of the   fight in Pakistan. </p>
      <p class="textMain">He then discussed how the present effort is very limited in scope. It is   focused in the South &amp; East, it is working with the local governments   (because of the corruption and ineffectiveness of the central government), and   it is limited to building up an honest &amp; effective police force and   otherwise providing security. He even specifically called out that this is not   about building schools and other &quot;nation building&quot; efforts. (Even the limited   effort, I think, qualifies as nation building &ndash; although on a more limited   scale.) </p>
      <p class="textMain">He clearly does have well informed view of the situation there and spoke   bluntly of the problems. A critical step 1 is to have a clear picture of the   problem. Senator Bennet does have that and speaks of the situation as it is. He   also said multiple times that Congress needs to &quot;hold the administration   accountable&quot; while watching their efforts on an ongoing basis. </p>
      <p class="textMain">Next was the question about why we gave the large banks everything they   wanted, but have nothing substantive for everyone else. Michaels's reply was to   discuss the needs for credit to be loosened up for small business. This seems to   be the conventional wisdom in D.C. right now &ndash; that the big issue for the   economy is to get credit to small businesses, and from that there will be more   jobs created. I agree this is needed (at my company we have to pay our credit   card bills every 2 weeks because they won't give us a limit that can handle a   month's worth of charges &ndash; and we have zero debt). But I don't think this is   going to bring us out of recession. </p>
      <p class="textMain">On that note, I asked what are they doing in the Senate to address this issue   as they keep talking about it, but we need action. Senator Bennet's reply was   &quot;they [the White House] seem to have finally got it because they had their jobs   summit this week and we'll have to see what comes out of that.&quot; I am   disappointed that I heard nothing else on this issue &ndash; not even thoughts on   things they might consider to address the economy. </p>
      <p class="textMain">Note: Every interview, after it ends, I think of one question I should have   asked. For this one I should have asked him how we're going to address the   Craigslist effect. Ten years ago the newspaper classified industry probably   supplied 100,000 jobs. Craigslist with 28 people eliminated those jobs. How do   we find jobs for all the cases where massive numbers of jobs are eliminated with   new technology. </p>
      <p class="textMain">I then asked Senator Bennet if he was too tied to the financial industry to   be willing to address the changes needed. He came back speaking with great   emphasis that he is not worrying about protecting Wall St. He then read me the   statement he put out on this issue (the one time in the conversation he was   reading from a script). His concern is the community banks that did not cause   this problem, are by and large not an issue, and he doesn't want them &quot;to have a   series of regulations that further constrain their lending.&quot; </p>
      <p class="textMain">He also discussed how his financial background is a benefit as it lets him   better understand what happened. And he called out the disaster as being driven   by &quot;pure greed&quot; on the part of the major banks. His desire is to address the   &quot;massive irresponsibility of the Wall St bank holding companies.&quot; He also wants   to make sure we don't bring in regulations that cause problems while not   helping. </p>
      <p class="textMain">We then went on to &quot;too big to fail&quot; and Bennet immediately launched in to   the moral hazard of the bank rescue because we've now made it clear that the   government does back the large banks which, by itself, will allow even greater   risk taking. Here's where he had a very interesting choice of words, that &quot;we   need to put very onerous capital requirements on financial institutions that get   to a size&hellip;&quot; If Senator Bennet is in thrall to the big banks as some have   claimed, I don't see why he would use phrases like this in passing. This is the   phrasing of someone who is looking to bring in some real restraint on the   system. </p>
      <p class="textMain">He sees the solution having two main parts. First that the TB2F banks will   have significantly increased capital requirements. Second will be a fund used to   handle the failure of any TB2F bank, self-funded by those same banks. He   believes that this self-funding will cause the institutions to self police as   they are the ones that will have to pay more into the fund if one of them goes   belly-up. (I'm not sure the self-policing will do much to stop all of them   racing off the cliff together.) </p>
      <p class="textMain">I then asked about full disclosure and transparency for the derivates market.   He says we will have a clearinghouse model for most of them. But that there are   some that don't fit this model and they will be handled differently. He believes   they can stop people from trying to push everything through the exceptions case   which don't have all the requirements. </p>
      <p class="textMain">He then brought up the very good point that the people who buy and sell   derivatives are in favor of a clearinghouse as they will then get better   pricing. He stated that the market has been opaque for no good reason. (Actually   it was opaque for a very good reason &ndash; it let the banks make more handling the   trades.) </p>
      <p class="textMain">Note: I did not ask him about his vote on cram-down because time was limited   and I didn't think I would get a different answer from the other 40 times he's   been asked the question. </p>
      <p class="textMain">Then on to healthcare. I asked if he thinks the public option will pass, and   he thinks it will. He also thinks the chances of it passing are much better   today than even 2 months ago. </p>
      <p class="textMain">I then asked about reducing what we spend on healthcare. Interesting answer &ndash;   Michael then discussed the subsidies available to people to help them buy   insurance. (That doesn't do squat to reduce what we spend as a country on   healthcare, it just changes who pays for it.) He then brought up trying to move   healthcare to pay for outcomes rather than procedures (this does reduce total   costs). </p>
      <p class="textMain">He then discussed a number of proposals to give people more info about what   procedures should cost, reducing administrative costs, etc. He further discussed   the core issue &ndash; how well the administration implements the system. This is a   giant piece of the puzzle and I think he is spot-on to bring this up as the   biggest influence on costs. </p>
      <p class="textMain">I also asked about pharmaceutical research as that can bring us gigantic   savings. He discussed a bill that helps pharma get a good return on their   investments and does see this as a major solution to costs. But nothing else on   this issue (I guess Senators can't be on top of every single aspect of every   issue). </p>
      <p class="textMain">We were out of time so for the environment I asked what he personally thought   cars will be running on in 10 years. He thinks fleet vehicles will be on natural   gas and personal vehicles will be electric. (T. Boone Pickens will be pleased   with that answer.) </p>
      <p class="textMain">On education I asked him what he thought of the idea of having a GI Bill type   effort to pull a bunch of people out of the job market and push them in to   college. He discussed the increases we have in Pell funding and how the colleges   are full because so many more are going to college right now. He also spoke of   the funding crisis state systems are facing, calling out Colorado &amp;   California specifically. </p>
      <p class="textMain">I closed asking when was the last time he went to one of the Smithsonian   Museums. It was before he was a Senator. He once asked his scheduler if they   ever got free time and she told him no. Personally, I think Washington would run   a lot better if all of our Congresspeople would take an hour once a week to   leave their cell phone in the office and wander the mall. </p>
      <h2 class="textMain">Conclusion </h2>
      <p class="textMain">First off, what I never heard. There was not a single word that could be   viewed as partisanship. I don't think he ever said the word Republican and maybe   said Democratic once. He said Iraq was a mistake but aside from that not a word   denigrating anyone. Even when I made a comment about the Bush Administration   ineptitude, he didn't pile on. </p>
      <p class="textMain">Second, not a single word that could be construed as campaigning. He faces a   serious primary challenger and a really bloody general challenge &ndash; and not a   word about what a great job Michael Bennet is doing, how much we get from him,   etc. He's not an idiot and I'm sure he is thinking about the campaign at least   some of the time. But in over &frac12; hour of an interview &ndash; not a peep. </p>
      <p class="textMain">Which leads to what we have with Michael Bennet &ndash; a Senator who takes the   responsibility of his job seriously, is working to be well informed on the   issues they face, and is giving a lot of thought to those issues. He also speaks   directly and honestly to those issues, and that is of tremendous benefit in   having effective conversations about what we should do. </p>
      <p class="textMain">I do think the people who call him a Conservadem are off-base. He is   definitely more of a centrist (as is the state of Colorado &ndash; outside of   Boulder). But a lot of that &quot;centrism&quot; is his trying to determine what will work   best, what makes financial sense, how can we afford what we want to do. A lot of   that deserves the label of being grounded in reality more than anything else.</p>
