      <h1>Summary</h1>
      <p class="textMain">First off I'm moderately liberal (or as it's described up here in Boulder, a   right wing reactionary). But I try to be even-handed and fair when I lay out the   choices in the state level races. </p>
      <p class="textMain">Second, we Democrats have done a lousy job <strong>at the federal   level</strong>. But at the state level I think we've done very well dealing with   an awful situation. I also think the Republican members of the legislature have   done a good job. A lot of very important legislation was crafted and passed this   past session with active effort by members on both sides of the aisle.</p>
      <h1>Governor &ndash; Hick-inator vs. The Tanc </h1>
      <p class="textMain">John Hickenlooper comes with the best possible preparation for the job, mayor   of our largest city. As mayor of Denver he has done a good job of professionally   managing the city and handling the cuts required from reduced revenue. He will   almost certainly continue the existing approach of trying to further streamline   the government. </p>
      <p class="textMain">Tom Tancredo comes with decent experience having managed a division of the   federal Department of Education and as a U.S. Congressman. It will take him a   bit longer to get up to speed but he should be very capable of doing so. He will   almost certainly address some of the budget constraints by reducing state   employee salaries and benefits to the level he thinks is appropriate. There is   some validity to this approach, but it's going to be a bloody fight. </p>
      <p class="textMain">Both have said they are going to look closely at what they can do to help   Colorado businesses grow jobs. And there is a lot the state can do. John   Hickenlooper will lean more toward actions the state will take to help while Tom   Tancredo will lean more toward things the state should stop doing to get out of   the way. A good example is Oil &amp; Gas regulation where Hick will look for   ways to reduce the negative impact of the regulations while Tanc will look to   roll them back. My take on eliminating the Oil &amp; Gas regulations is that   it's akin to renting your house to a rock band &ndash; the initial check is great but   when you come back to a wrecked house and your dog has been molested, it's not   that good a deal. </p>
      <p class="textMain">If you want the state to reduce its size, reduce what it does, you should   vote for Tom Tancredo. He will use the reduced revenues as a means to   accomplishing this. If you want the state to continue its present service level,   with improvements, but the level we are at, and an increase when the economy   recovers, then you should vote for John Hickenlooper. </p>
      <p class="textMain">And no matter which one wins, most of their job will be trying to minimize   the impact of further major reductions in state funding. And regardless of which   one wins, higher education is hosed (the constraints in the constitution leave   Higher Ed and prisons as the only large budget items that can be cut). </p>
      <h1>Treasurer &ndash; Kennedy vs. Stapleton </h1>
      <p class="textMain">The treasurer has a single primary job &ndash; keep the state funds safe and get a   decent return on the investment. That's it. Yes they go talk about various   issues. Yes they help set up financial systems to assist government entities   that have limited resources and bonding ability. But the key issue is the state   funds. Any money lost in the invested funds is an additional budget cut. </p>
      <p class="textMain">Cary Kennedy has done a superb job where the state has lost no invested funds   and has had a return on the investment that most Wall St investment houses can't   equal. With a record like this I don't care what party the Treasurer is, I don't   care what their political philosophy is, they have my vote. I'd vote for Dick   Cheney if he was delivering these results. </p>
      <p class="textMain">Walker Stapleton might do a good job. But the best he could aspire to is to   equal Cary's track record. Walker himself has said that Cary has done a good   job, but he thinks he can do better. However, he has nothing to demonstrate that   his investment acumen would be superior. He has stated that he will use his   investment banker background to try and improve on Cary's record. With higher   risk comes higher reward so he could get us a better return, but we could also   end up with significant losses. </p>
      <p class="textMain">If you view the Treasurer position as getting the best return on our   investments, and doing so safely, then you should vote for Cary. If you're   willing to take a larger risk of losing some of our investments, but possibly   getting a higher return from those investments, then you should vote for Walker.   Personally I just don't see how it makes any sense to change Treasurer with her   results. Especially when state revenues are declining further. </p>
      <h1>Attorney General &ndash; Garnett vs. Suthers </h1>
      <p class="textMain">John Suthers has been our Attorney General for the last 6 years and until   recently was viewed by Democrats &amp; Republicans as doing a good job. Yes we   Democrats would disagree with some of his decisions more often than Republicans,   but all in all a competent fair AG. The Attorney General in many ways should be   run in a nonpartisan manner and Suthers, just like Ken Salazar, has (mostly)   done that. But&hellip; </p>
      <p class="textMain">John Suthers was previously the U.S. Attorney for Colorado. At that time he   approved the temporary release of convicted felon Scott Kimball, an individual   who one judge had stated should never be released. John spent 5 minutes   reviewing the request, approved it, and provided no oversight of Kimball after   he was released. </p>
      <p class="textMain"><strong>Scott Kimball then murdered 4 people, including a 16 year old   girl</strong> (<a href="http://www.kdvr.com/videobeta/?watchId=b47e8e6f-02eb-4b55-b753-d7cf68a05f68">details   from Fox News</a>). </p>
      <p class="textMain">I think it would be unconsciousable to re-elect and individual who sprung a   felon from prison early, for no good reason, with no real supervision, leaving   him free to murder innocent people. And <a href="http://www.kdvr.com/news/kdvr-kimball-ag-race-txt,0,5817812.story">John   Suthers has disclaimed any responsibility for this</a>. If holding our elected   officials accountable is to have any meaning, I think we must vote for Stan   Garnett. (<a href="http://www.davidthielen.info/politics/2010/10/attorney-general-john-suthers-murderer-scott-kimball.html">I have more here about why I think this should disqualify John Suthers from your consideration.)</a></p>
      <p class="textMain">Stan Garnett is the District Attorney for Boulder County where he has been   doing a superb job and has been scrupulously fair as well as significantly   improved the efficiency of the office. Stan is clearly qualified and would make   the A.G. office more focused on what it can do to help the people of Colorado. </p>
      <h1>Secretary of State &ndash; Buescher vs. Gessler </h1>
      <p class="textMain">Bernie Buescher has been the Secretary of State for the last two years and   has continued in the Mike Coffman approach (previous SoS, a Republican) of   running the office effectively and in a nonpartisan manner. However, Bernie has   also ignored the serious problem where his office allows criminals to   fraudulently take over as the registered agent for any company registered in   Colorado. </p>
      <p class="textMain">Scott has spent a lot of his professional career working for very partisan   Republican groups including Coloradans for Change, Colorado Conservative Voters,   and the list goes on... Now this is not proof that he would be partisan in the   SoS office, after all this is a partisan elected position. <a href="http://coloradopols.com/diary/14154/reminder-scott-gessler-is-a-joke">But it is reason for   great concern</a>. On the plus side, he has said that he will make securing company   registrations one of his top priorities in office. </p>
      <p class="textMain">If you want a Secretary of State that is mostly nonpartisan, but does lean a   little Democratic, and you're not too concerned about the ongoing theft the SoS   office presently enables, then you want to vote for Bernie. If you want a   Secretary of State that will shut down the ongoing theft the office enables, or   you want a SoS that would probably lean heavily Republican, then you want to   vote for Scott. </p>
      <p class="textMain">Personally I'm torn on this one. Because the SoS oversees elections I want   them to be nonpartisan and I think Bernie is a better choice by that criteria.   But as a business owner I don't want to see companies robbed, and the   accompanying job loss that entails. </p>
      <h1>State Legislature </h1>
      <p class="textMain">I think the legislature this past session did a superb job. Not only was a   lot of that a bipartisan effort, but the main legislation shoved through in a   partisan manner was some of the worst thought out of the session (undoing some   of the tax exemptions). I know I will get yelled at by my fellow Democrats but I   think the best thing for our state, and Colorado comes before party for me, is a   divided legislature. </p>
      <p class="textMain">So for the House, if you are undecided, my suggestion is to vote for the   Democratic candidate. They are by and large quality candidates (<a href="http://www.denverpost.com/election2010/ci_16191395">there are a few   exceptions</a>). The House is going to stay Democratic. </p>
      <p class="textMain">And for the Senate, if you are undecided, my suggestion&hellip; uh&hellip; OW! eh.eh&hellip; I   can't say it! Well let's say that there are a number of quality candidates,   although <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/election2010/ci_16191395">there are   also a surprising number that have serious felony arrest records</a>. But if   it's a Republican without a record for domestic violence or other serious   felony, give them a look. </p>
      <p class="textMain">I hope this is of some help. As always, <a href="http://www.davidthielen.info/politics/2010/10/the-choices-for-the-colorado-state-races.html">comments are very welcome</a>.    </p>
