      <h2>One key requirement of &ldquo;Representative&rdquo; Government</h2>
      <p class="textMain">I think one absolutely critical requirement for our government to function is   for our representatives to listen to the voters. To all of them. Without this   ongoing feedback our elected officials become a body divorced from the people,   swayed primarily by the few who have access to them. When that happens we lose   something precious and vital about what makes America work. </p>
<p class="textMain">It is true that we were initially designed as a Republic where the President   and Senators were elected indirectly. But from the beginning the House was   elected directly. And the assumption, and practice, from the beginning was that   all of our elected officials were accessible to anyone. Through all of the   1800's most anybody could talk to the President if they wanted to. </p>
      <p class="textMain">Why is this so important? A couple of reasons: </p>
      <ol>
        <li class="textMain">Without constant ongoing feedback from the voters, all the voters, it is   impossible for an elected official to represent us. Yes they can read the polls,   run surveys, get summations of incoming letters. That has a minimal impact   compared to interacting with the voters. Direct two-way communication is   essential &ndash; both for the politician and for their constituents. The impact on   constituents is every bit as important as the impact on the officeholder. </li>
        <li class="textMain">This shows us if the individual will fight for us. Someone who is afraid to   discuss issues with people that might disagree with them is not going to slug it   out in the sausage factory. When Tom Tancredo ran away from a news discussion   when asked a single snarky question by Markos, he made it painfully clear that   he does not have the intestinal fortitude to actually accomplish anything in   office. </li>
        <li class="textMain">Clear concise answers to hard questions is where the rubber meets the road.   All politicians love to say lower taxes, more services, and a balanced budget.   If they are not confronted with the hard questions, that is all we'll hear (from   both sides). Only when we push do we learn how they will actually solve the   issues we face. Because in the triangle of lower taxes, more services, and a   balanced budget &ndash; you get to pick two. <br />
          And it's not just this one issue. On   question after question, God is in the details. Want to address illegal   immigration? Great. How do you better seal the border? How do you reduce the   economic rewards to foreigners and Americans for breaking the law? What is the   appropriate number of guest workers and what are the requirements for them? The   list goes on &ndash; and only by asking do we see if someone has answers or is just   hot air. </li>
        <li class="textMain">G.W. Bush showed us the danger of having a leader who lives in a bubble   surrounded by yes-(wo)men. True interaction with people who disagree with you is   uncomfortable and can cause political problems. However, it's the only way to   have your ideas face critical scrutiny. And when that scrutiny is avoided, you   end up with minor problems like the Iraq War. </li>
      </ol>
      <p class="textMain">What's also interesting is that when it comes to the hard questions, most   voters across the political spectrum have the same questions. We will differ in   what answer we prefer, but we all want to find out where a candidate stands on   these core issues. There are not questions from the left and other questions   from the right &ndash; there are questions from all the voters. </p>
      <p class="textMain">We're in a world of hurt right now. At the federal level we still have a   horrendous problem with jobs &amp; the economy. We need to address the   intertwined mess of energy/foreign oil/global warming. We're fighting two hot   wars as well as the more difficult nebulous global war on terror. Healthcare   will remain a major problem, even if (especially if according to some) the bill   is passed. The list of major problems goes on. </p>
      <p class="textMain">And at the state level we face the issue of declining revenues in a time of   increased demand for services. When the federal stimulus funds end next year, we   stop funding higher ed (thereby devastating our future). We have a financial   convoluted straitjacket in our constitution that is driving us off a cliff. And   our K-12 educational system (as is true in every other state) is a disaster that   presently insures that China, India, and others will surpass us, leaving us a   2nd world country. </p>
      <p class="textMain">We need to determine if the people asking for our vote have what it takes to   address these problems. That means we have individuals who will talk to us, will   answer the hard questions, and give us answers that lead us to believe they can   resolve these issues. </p>
      <p class="textMain">Lets first look at who fails on this count &ndash; Representative Lamborn and   Senator Udall (at least they can take joy in their bi-partisan issuing of the   middle finger to the voters). They both reside in their fortress of solitude,   venturing forth only to cast votes and ask for donations. Senator Udall tries to   fake it, by making surprise visits to public groups that his team has swept to   insure that he will hear no disagreeable opinion &ndash; and then issuing a press   release about his &quot;public meeting.&quot; Even if we like their votes, that doesn't   mean they represent us. </p>
      <p class="textMain">Now let's look at those who embrace the concept of interacting with the   voters. That doesn't mean they go talk to every single voter, as there are not   enough hours in the day, and many voters have no interest. But it does mean town   halls, talking to a wide range of press, bloggers, issue groups etc &ndash; and not   just the ones that like you. By far the best example of this is Representative   Polis. When the town hall craziness occurred in August, Jared scheduled more   town halls because he saw it as a chance to talk to more voters. </p>
      <p class="textMain">Second is Ken Buck. I sat down with him one time to <a href="http://www.davidthielen.info/politics/2009/10/ken-buck-interview.html">ask   him a bunch of question</a>. I was worried that he would get mad at me, or   refuse to give me real answers. What occurred was that on every single question   he calmly gave me a clear detailed answer. It went so smoothly I re-read the   questions after it was over to make sure they were &quot;hard-hitting.&quot; Ken views   questions as a chance to tell the voters where he stands. </p>
      <p class="textMain">Third is Governor Ritter. In my <a href="http://www.davidthielen.info/politics/2009/07/governor-ritter-some-q-a.html">Q&amp;A   with the Governor</a> it was scheduled for &frac12; hour and he kept it going for an   hour &ndash; and then apologized that he had to go to his next event. Yet on many of   the questions I asked, Bill Ritter was clearly not pleased that the issue was   coming up again. But when Bill Ritter is unhappy about being asked on an issue &ndash;   he responds by giving you full detail as to what &amp; why. Again, someone who   insures that the voters knows where he stands. </p>
      <p class="textMain">I do not mean to denigrate others by not listing them. Most of our top   elected officials, to a greater or lesser degree, do talk with a full   cross-section of voters, press, bloggers, etc. We are better off from this   interaction and they do their job better due to this interaction. </p>
      <p class="textMain">But for those challenging the incumbents, I think it is imperative that we   insist that they do the same. <strong>If in the campaign they avoid those that   might subject them to an uncomfortable question, how on earth can they do a   competent job when elected?</strong> I'm not asking if I will agree with them,   I'm asking the more basic issue of simple competence regardless of political   philosophy. If a candidate is incapable of performing the job well, does their   politics matter much? </p>
      <p class="textMain">And by the same token, if a candidate will not give a real answer to the   fundamental questions that voters across the spectrum want answered, do they   stand for anything? If they don't stand for anything, we don't know what we will   get. <strong>A person who will say anything to get elected, will do anything   once they are in office.</strong> I've voted for Republicans before, rarely   because I agreed with them, but generally because I will take a principled   conservative over an opportunistic liberal. </p>
      <p class="textMain">My concern is that many (not all!) of the challengers in this state are   trying to give vague answers, avoid challenging forums, and generally slide in   to office without ever standing for anything. This does not serve the state   well, it does not treat the voters with respect, and it is not representative   government. Or to give a more specific example, how effective a Represenative can Cory Gardner be if he's afraid to answer questions from press &amp; bloggers   who don't adore him? What approach will he take as Representative if he will not   answer the   basic questions that voters from the far right to the left want an answer   to? </p>
      <p class="textMain">We're in a world of hurt and in '10 I am not voting straight Democratic &ndash; I   am voting in each race for the person who I think will best help us get out of   this mess. That person is not the one with a nice smile, but no willingness to   fight and unable to articulate what they stand for.      </p>
