      <h2><a href="http://www.davidthielen.info/politics/2010/10/attorney-general-john-suthers-murderer-scott-kimball.html" jquery1287285274700="3">Attorney General John Suthers &amp; murderer Scott   Kimball</a></h2>
<p class="textMain">The fundamental tenet of medicine is &quot;first do no harm.&quot; We should expect the   same from our Attorney General. I believe that Attorney General John Suthers   violated this fundamental tenet of his job when he approved the early release of   felon Scott Kimball, who then went on to murder 4 people. Including a 16 year   old girl. </p>
      <h1>Early Release with No oversight </h1>
      <p class="textMain">When the FBI requested to release Scott Kimball from prison to operate   unsupervised as an informant, that required the approval of the U.S. Attorney &ndash;   John Suthers. The requirement is very specific, that the U.S. Attorney himself   must approve the action. It is a fundamental responsibility of the U.S. Attorney   to verify that the early release will lead to information that is worth the   risk, and that the convicted felon is under adequate supervision. What did John   Suthers do? <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/dontmiss/ci_15154719">From the   Denver Post, in his own words:</a></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="textMain">&quot;It's possible that at a briefing meeting they would have said, at the   request of the FBI we've transferred a guy down here and we're working with him   as an informant or something,&quot; Suthers said of the regular meetings he held with   officials in his office. &quot;But I have no knowledge of that, and it appears I had   no meetings about the case or anything, and <strong>I have no recollection of   any involvement in the case</strong>.&quot;</p>
        <p class="textMain">Suthers said that he might have signed the documents as part of the   administrative work brought to him by deputy attorneys. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="textMain">Scott Kimball was arrested for a parole violation at the request of the State   of Washington. But at the request of John Suthers' office, they dropped the   charge. <a href="http://www.kdvr.com/news/kdvr-kimball-ag-race-txt,0,5817812.story">As   reported by Fox news:</a></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="textMain">FOX31 News has learned that Suthers' team called --what sources describe as--   a secret summit conference. It was held on June 20, 2003. The FBI, DEA, Denver   Police and four people from Suthers' office were there. </p>
        <p class="textMain">Insiders say Denver Police were skeptical, but Suthers' office prevailed and   once again Kimball was set free. </p>
        <p class="textMain">Within the next few months, he killed Kaysi McLeod and his uncle, Terry   Kimball. His family believes he tried to kill his own son and investigators   believe he tortured and killed another young woman. Yet the next month, Suthers'   team was back in court telling the judge, who was increasingly &quot;troubled&quot; over   the way Kimball was being handled, that they had him on &quot;a very tight leash.&quot; </p>
        <p class="textMain">&quot;Well, <strong>he wasn't on a tight leash</strong>. As far as we can tell   from looking at the records, really, <strong>nobody was paying attention to   anything that was happening</strong>,&quot; says Boulder District Attorney Stan   Garnett. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <h1>What Did the FBI get from Scott? </h1>
      <p class="textMain"><a href="http://www.kdvr.com/news/kdvr-kimball-ag-race-txt,0,5817812.story">In   Scott Kimball's own words:</a></p>
      <blockquote>       <p class="textMain">&quot;I never gave them any useful information,&quot; Kimball says. </p>    </blockquote>
      <p class="textMain">Four (<a href="http://www.denverpost.com/commented/ci_16077161?source=commented-">or   more</a>) innocent people dead, people who would be alive if John Suthers had   exercised any judgment, and for it nothing. </p>
      <h1>Why did the Early Release for Scott Kimball? </h1>
      <p class="textMain">Why did the FBI ask for an early release? Why did John Suthers approve an   early release? Because <em>&quot;he claimed his cellmate planned to arrange for the   murder of a witness in a drug case.&quot;</em> That's right, a convicted con man   claimed he was asked to murder a witness and that was sufficient for the FBI and   John Suthers to spring him &ndash; unsupervised. This was completely brain dead &ndash;   anyone in prison is willing to lie to get out. Approving this showed zero   judgment. </p>
      <h1>Should They Have Known Better? </h1>
      <p class="textMain">While releasing Scott Kimball based on an unverified statement was clearly   dumb, John Suthers claims that they had no reason to believe Scott Kimball would   commit additional felonies upon release? Really? That statement shows additional   poor judgment. </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="textMain"><a href="http://scottleekimball.com/wp-content/uploads/2000/04/mont-prison.pdf">Judge   John Henson on sentencing Scott Kimball to 10 years in prison said:</a> <em>&quot;The   Defendant is impossible to supervise in a community setting&hellip; Because of the   Defendant's character and attitude, the Defendant is likely to commit another   crime.&quot;</em></li>
        <li class="textMain"><a href="http://scottleekimball.com/scott-kimball/scott-kimball-accused-of-rape-a-second-time/">From   the Spokane Washington Police Department:</a> <em>&quot;Scott Kimball's ex-wife,   Larissa Hentz, makes a second rape report against him. She tells Spokane, Wash.,   police that he broke into her house with the help of a locksmith friend, pressed   a gun to her head while she lay sleeping, and raped her repeatedly.&quot;</em></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="textMain">There is no way someone like this should have been released early. Scott had   a clear history of preying upon society including rape, and his total lack of   concern about anyone else made murder a definite possibility. To release him   without supervision showed a total lack of judgment on the part of the FBI and   John Suthers. </p>
      <h1>And Even More May Have Been Missed </h1>
      <p class="textMain">And it gets worse. It looks like Scott Kimball could be responsible for   several other murders here in Colorado. Murders that if he had been caught on,   would have precluded subsequent killings. Scott Kimball could be the largest   mass-murderer in state history. </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="textMain"><a href="http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-news/ci_15772902">The FBI   is investigating Scott as a potential suspect in several unsolved   disappearances.</a></li>
        <li class="textMain"><a href="http://www.denverpost.com/commented/ci_16077161">Westminster Police   are investigating if Scott Kimball murdered Catrina Powell in 2004.</a></li>
        <li class="textMain"><a href="http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_16352864">A Denver Post article   led authorities to investigate if Scott Kimball murdered Peggy Hettrick in   1987</a> (yes, the Denver Post had to lead John Suthers' office to this   investigation). </li>
        <li class="textMain"><a href="http://www.kdvr.com/news/kdvr-kimball-murders-txt,0,5322366.story">A Fox   31 story led authorities to investigate if Scott Kimball murdered 7 year old   Tracy Neef in 1984</a> (yes Fox News had to lead John Suthers' office to this   investigation). </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="textMain">This is not just missed signs, this is wholesale incompetence. What does it   say when it requires the news media to do the initial work for the Attorney   General's office? </p>
      <h1>Accountability </h1>
      <p class="textMain">I understand that life is imperfect, and even the best of us makes mistakes.   I understand that things that are clear in hindsight can be a lot more opaque at   the time decisions must be made. And investigating criminals requires dealing   with other criminals, who tend to be low-life scum. That's the world we have to   work with. </p>
      <p class="textMain">But this goes so far beyond that. By any measure this was gross incompetence.   By any measure this was a combination of zero judgment, no follow-through, and   an inability to see clear evidence of Scott Kimball's involvement in murder   after murder. And the key person at the center of this total cluster-fuck is   John Suthers. </p>
      <p class="textMain"><strong>If we are to hold our elected officials accountable, if we are to   insist on minimal competence, then we must vote John Suthers out of office. Not   just to require accountability, but also for our own safety. </strong></p>
      <p class="textMain"><strong>If John Suthers is reelected then there are no consequences for   actions in office.</strong>      </p>
