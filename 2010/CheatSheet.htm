      <h2>Voter Guide to 2010 Colorado Amendments </h2>
      <h1><img src="../images/bomb.png" alt="vote no" width="24" height="24" /> COLORADO AMENDMENT 60 </h1>
      <h4>Reduce Property Taxes</h4>
      <p class="textMain">Immediately reduce some property taxes, make it easier to reduce property taxes, and make it more difficult to increase property taxes. Will force a reduction in the state budget of 1.5 billion/year (that's the total presently spent on law enforcement (courts &amp; prisons) and health services).</p>
      <p class="textMain">The true purpose of this amendment is to drastically reduce the size and role of government in Colorado and to reduce property taxes. If you live out of state and own lots of property in Colorado, it's a sweet deal.<strong> If you live in Colorado, this will directly reduce your quality of life.</strong> <strong><a href="colorado-amendment-60-property-taxes.htm">Vote No.</a></strong>    </p>
      <h1><img src="../images/bomb.png" alt="vote no" width="24" height="24" /> COLORADO AMENDMENT 61 </h1>
      <h4>Limit Borrowing</h4>
      <p class="textMain">This will fully end state borrowing and significant restrict borrowing by local governments. Just as we borrow money for a major purchase like a home or car, the government borrows money for major projects. This would require the full cost be saved in advance of any purchase.</p>
      <p class="textMain">The true purpose of this amendment is to drastically reduce the size and role of government in Colorado and to reduce future taxes.<strong> If you live in Colorado, this will directly reduce your quality of life.</strong> <strong><a href="colorado-amendment-61-limits-state-local-borrowing.htm">Vote No.</a></strong></p>
      <h1><img src="../images/bomb.png" alt="vote no" width="24" height="24" /> COLORADO AMENDMENT 62 </h1>
      <h4>Outlaw Abortion</h4>
      <p class="textMain">This is officially an amendment to define what is meant by &quot;person&quot; in the constitution. But what it is in fact is an amendment that would outlaw not just abortion at any point, but even any birth control that occurs after the egg is fertilized including most birth control pills.<strong> <a href="colorado-amendment-62-application-person-abortion.htm">Vote yes if you believe any abortion and most birth control pills should be illegal. Vote no otherwise.</a></strong></p>
      <h1><img src="../images/bomb.png" alt="vote no" width="24" height="24" /> COLORADO AMENDMENT 63 </h1>
      <h4>Make Health Care Reform Optional</h4>
      <p class="textMain">This is designed to make the recently passed health-care legislation optional for residents of Colorado. It's probably unconstitutional, but it maybe not so treat it seriously.</p>
      <p class="textMain">Unless we are willing to let people without insurance die at the emergency room door, we will provide universal healthcare. Simple fairness then requires that the government at some level mandate coverage to match that delivered emergency care. <strong><a href="colorado-amendment-63-health-care-choice.htm">Vote No.</a></strong></p>
      <h1><img src="../images/bomb.png" alt="vote no" width="24" height="24" /> COLORADO INITIATIVE 101</h1>
      <h4>Eliminate Numerous Fees, Reduce Income Tax</h4>
      <p class="textMain">Drop vehicle fees down to $1.00 and reduce the state income tax rate from 4.5% to 3.5%. In other words a 25% reduction in the services the state can provide.</p>
      <p class="textMain">The true purpose of this initiative is to drastically reduce the size and role of government in Colorado and to reduce taxes.<strong> If you live in Colorado, this will directly reduce your quality of life.</strong> <strong><a href="colorado-initiative-101-income-vehicle-telecommunication-taxes-fees.htm">Vote No.</a></strong></p>
      <h1><img src="../images/bomb.png" alt="vote no" width="24" height="24" /> COLORADO INITIATIVE 102</h1>
      <h4>Criteria for Setting Bail and Type of Bond</h4>
      <p class="textMain">Requires a bond for anyone arrested unless it's their first offense and it's a nonviolent misdemeanor.</p>
      <p class="textMain">This is a decision the legislature has properly handled, there is no need to bring in an initiative.<strong></strong> <strong><a href="colorado-initiative-101-income-vehicle-telecommunication-taxes-fees.htm">Vote No.</a></strong></p>
      <h1>COLORADO AMENDMENT P</h1>
      <h4>Regulating Games of Chance</h4>
      <p class="textMain">Bingo and raffles are presently licensed by the Secretary of State. This moves it to the Department of Revenue which regulates all similiar items.</p>
      <p class="textMain">This is placed on the ballot by a bipartisan majority of the state legislature. It makes the state a bit more efficient. <strong><a href="colorado-amendment-p-regulating-games-chance.htm">Vote Yes.</a></strong></p>
      <h1>COLORADO AMENDMENT Q</h1>

      <p class="textMain">Establish a process for moving the state seat of government to a temporary location during a declared disaster emergency.</p>

If terrorists set off a nuclear device in Denver, this will let the state respond quicker. <strong><a href="colorado-amendment-q-temporary-location-state-seat-government.htm">Vote Yes.</a></strong></p>
      <h1>COLORADO AMENDMENT R</h1>
      <h4>Exempt Possessory Interests in Real Property</h4>
